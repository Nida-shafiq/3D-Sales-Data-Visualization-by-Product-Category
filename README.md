**Sales Data Analysis and Visualization**

    This project aims to analyze sales data and provide insights through data processing and visualization techniques. It involves processing raw sales data to extract meaningful features and then visualizing the total sales by product category using a 3D bar chart. The key steps include:

**Data Processing:**

    Encoding product categories into dummy variables.
    Replacing boolean values with numeric values (True/False to 1/2).
    Extracting date components like year, month, and day for better temporal analysis.
    Calculating the total price for each transaction based on quantity and unit price.
**Visualization:**

    Creating a 3D bar chart to represent total sales for each product category.
    Using a color gradient to represent sales volume visually.
    Displaying exact sales values on top of each bar for clarity.

This project helps in identifying sales trends and making informed decisions based on the performance of various product categories.
